# TRANSFERRING MOTHS {#moth-transfers}

## Materials

-   Forceps
-   Soft forceps

## Methods

The original diet cups become overcrowded around 4 weeks (\~28 days) as
the larvae grow.

### Sanitizing and Preparing Grubs for Transfer

1.  Cups contaminated with bacteria or mold should be removed prior to
    separation of grubs and recorded as losses on the *Galleria*
    discard datasheet, \@ref(discard-datasheet).
