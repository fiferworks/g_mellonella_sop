% This is the Reed College LaTeX thesis template. Most of the work
% for the document class was done by Sam Noble (SN), as well as this
% template. Later comments etc. by Ben Salzberg (BTS). Additional
% restructuring and APA support by Jess Youngberg (JY).
% Your comments and suggestions are more than welcome; please email
% them to cus@reed.edu
%
% See https://www.reed.edu/cis/help/LaTeX/index.html for help. There are a
% great bunch of help pages there, with notes on
% getting started, bibtex, etc. Go there and read it if you're not
% already familiar with LaTeX.
%
% Any line that starts with a percent symbol is a comment.
% They won't show up in the document, and are useful for notes
% to yourself and explaining commands.
% Commenting also removes a line from the document;
% very handy for troubleshooting problems. -BTS

%Packages are extensions to the basic LaTeX functions. Whatever you want to
%typeset, there is probably a package out there for it. Chemistry (chemtex),
%screenplays, you name it. Check out CTAN to see: https://www.ctan.org/ Also,
%Rmarkdown can read LaTex commands in Rmd files, so long as the output is a pdf,
%because pdfs are rendered by Rmarkdown via LaTex
