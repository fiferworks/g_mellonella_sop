# TRANSFERRING NEONATE LARVAE {#neonate-transfer}

## Materials

-   BÃ¼chner funnel
-   Fast flow filter paper

## Methods

### Creating a Grub Shaker {#make-grub-shake}

Transferring newly hatched

### Surface Sterilizing Neonate Larvae {#sterilizing-neonates}

Any fungal spores or bacteria on the skin of the larvae will be
transferred directly to the diet cups, so it is necessary to sterilize
the larvae before they are transferred to avoid contamination.
Transferring larvae should be done in a clean room on a sanitized
surface, while wearing surgical gloves, facemasks, and hairnets to
reduce the risks of microbial contamination.

1.  Sanitize any surfaces and utensils which will be used by spraying
    and wiping the work space with 75% isopropyl alcohol.
