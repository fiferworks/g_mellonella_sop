<!-- Above is the YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) header that includes a lot
of metadata used to produce the document.  Be careful with spacing in this
header! If you'd prefer to not include a Dedication, for example, simply delete
the section entirely, or silence them (add # before each line). If you have
other LaTeX packages you would like to include, delete the # before
header-includes and list the packages after hyphens on new lines. If you'd like
to include a comment that won't be produced in your resulting file enclose it in
a block like this. If you receive a duplicate label error after knitting, make
sure to delete the index.Rmd file and then knit again. -->
