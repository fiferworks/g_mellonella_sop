# SHIPPING {#shipping}

```{=tex}
\textbf{Ship overnight on the sender's account number for institutions
(Universities, USDA, researchers, etc.) and on our own account number
for civilians. Include a return label as necessary. Remember to include a copy of our permit when shipping pests like \textit{Diaprepes!}}
```
## Larvae and Pupae {#ship-larvae-pupae}

Larvae and Pupae can be shipped in 50 ml centrifuge tubes with diet.

1.  Place cups with diet and larvae in 50 ml centrifuge tube  trays and place 2
    trays in a large ZiplocÂ®-style plastic freezer baggie.

2.  Put bagged trays together in a larger bag or trash bag.

3.  Put in appropriate size box, fill space with bubble wrap or air
    bags, etc.

4.  Tape box well, reinforce the bottom of the box with tape.

5.  Label with 'This side up' before shipping.

## Adults {#ship-adults}

Teneral adults in their diet cups can be shipped as-is, in the same way
we ship larvae.

1.  Adults from cages can be shipped in an empty clean diet cup with a
    damp dental wick.

2.  Ship with a ice pack wrapped a paper towel.

3.  Do not use an ice pack for teneral adults.

## Eggs {#ship-eggs}

Eggs are more fragile, but can still be shipped if needed.

1.  If shipping eggs, ship freshly laid eggs, eggs about to hatch do not
    survive well.

2.  Double-bag eggs in small to medium ziploc baggies with the air
    gently squeezed out from the bag to prevent desiccation.

3.  \textbf{Be careful not to squash eggs when squeezing out air!}

4.  Ensure both zippers on the plastic baggie are sealed well.

5.  Place the nested baggies into a large bag inflated with air, to help
    protect eggs from damage.

6.  Pack the baggies in a small box with plenty of bubble wrap or air
    bags.
